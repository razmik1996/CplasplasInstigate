It's a program for showing my exercises solutions.

1. Calculating arithmetic operations
Write a program which will allow user to input a valid arithmetic expression (number operation
number) and will print out the result.
E.g. Input 5 + 6 Output "5 + 6 = 11"

5. Inverse the number
Write a program which will input an integer number and calculate the inverse of the number.
Print the output.
E.g. Input 163 - Output 361

14. Guess a number (roles changed)
Write a program which asks the user to think a of random number from 1 to 100 and try to
guess the number. The user must tell the computer whether the guessed number is too high
or too low.
Modify the program so that no matter what number the user thinks of (1-100) the computer
can guess it in 7 or less guesses.

15. Minimum and maximum
Write a program to input 10 numbers and find the minimal and maximal numbers in the
sequence. Print the results.

16. Occurence of numbers
Write a program which will allow user to input numbers in range 1-10 (as much as the user
would like to, till -1 is entered). Calculate and print how many times each of the numbers have
been entered.

17. Decimal to binary
Write a program to input a number and convert it to binary (e.g in 4 bits)
e.g Input 5 , Output 0101
Enhance the program to support also negative numbers (calculate 2's complement)

18. Binary to decimal
Write a program to input a binary number (a sequence of 0-1s) and convert it to decimal. Print
the results.

21. Print the sum of all numbers in the given sequence of N whole numbers.

23. Input a sequence of N numbers and sort the sequence in ascending/descending order.

For documentation open html file /doc/html/index.html
Example firefox doc/html/index.html
You can run program after compiling just type make
for other commands
type make help
After compiling you can run program from bin/ (bin/program)
