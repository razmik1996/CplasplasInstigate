It's a program for showing my exercises solutions.

1. Calculating arithmetic operations
Write a program which will allow user to input a valid arithmetic expression (number operation
number) and will print out the result.
E.g. Input 5 + 6 Output "5 + 6 = 11"

5. Inverse the number
Write a program which will input an integer number and calculate the inverse of the number.
Print the output.
E.g. Input 163 - Output 361

14. Guess a number (roles changed)
Write a program which asks the user to think a of random number from 1 to 100 and try to
guess the number. The user must tell the computer whether the guessed number is too high
or too low.
Modify the program so that no matter what number the user thinks of (1-100) the computer
can guess it in 7 or less guesses.
